Before using the app!
Go to the server folder and find file 'Sentiment.js'
At the top of the file you will find this code block:

const { CONSUMER_KEY = 'vit3d6ZbmvOkVnjHvIEOIMu3u'
      , CONSUMER_SECRET = 'xLO7WWruY1n04JbiXpmI6VuCTfG0924wLOR5jDETsUAoovfjFO'
      , ACCESS_TOKEN = '4828009493-Rmb9xnJmwzKdMxK4AwY1YPNV0HtXpwORkJRdOEp'
      , ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET = 'bFD59pWkfSUIaaSok4lyJU2wvrbR9SWnuHQzf4RIhSFMb'
      } = process.env;

Consumer_Key, Consumer_Secret, Access_token and Access_Token_Secret are the values to access the twitter api, 
the ones which you see above are my one ones, created just for the test. Please go to https://apps.twitter.com/,
create new app and generate your own keys, so noone would know them and replace my keys with yours.

Save the file and move to running the server:

1. Open your command prompt and go to the server folder, using the 'cd' command.
2. Run the command 'node server.js'
3. After that the server will host on port 3000(set by default).
4. When the server is open(it will write the message in the command prompt) 
you can click on bubbles and get the result.
